# Video Player Application System Design Document


## Overview
The video player application provides users with the ability to watch educational content, track their progress, and save videos for offline viewing. It supports playback progress tracking, automatic video resumption, cross-origin video fetching, and local caching for offline access.

## System Components

### Video Player
   ReactPlayer Integration: Leverage ReactPlayer for video playback functionality, providing a layer of abstraction over the native HTML5 video element.
   Progress Tracking: Utilize onProgress event to monitor and save playback progress to local storage.
   Playback Resumption: Implement logic to retrieve and resume playback from the last saved position upon player initialization or manual play action.
   Offline Support: Allow users to download videos for offline viewing, storing the video content in the browser cache using the Service Worker API.
### Service Worker
   Caching Strategy: Implement a caching strategy to handle video content, static assets, and API responses, providing offline capabilities and network optimization.
   Cross-Origin Handling: Address CORS challenges by implementing proxy configuration in development and utilizing appropriate headers and API usage in production.
### Local Storage Management
   Persistence Layer: Use local storage to persist playback progress, application state, and user preferences.
   State Sync: Synchronize the application state with the local storage to maintain consistency across sessions.
   Data Handling: Implement functions to handle CRUD operations on local storage data, including error handling and state updates.
### User Interface
   Playback Controls: Provide custom playback controls, including a progress bar that supports click-to-seek functionality.
   Offline Availability Indicators: Design the UI to clearly indicate which videos are available for offline viewing.
### Error Handling and Debugging
   CORS Error Resolution: Integrate checks to identify and report CORS errors, implementing fallbacks or proxy solutions as necessary.
   Service Worker Updates: Ensure service worker updates are handled gracefully, with proper cache invalidation and version management.
### Backend Integration (If Applicable)
   API Endpoints: Define API endpoints for video metadata, user data, and content management.
   Authentication and Authorization: Implement OAuth for secure API calls, particularly when integrating with services like Google Drive.
   
## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Strategy
- Development Environment: Utilize Vite's proxy feature to handle CORS in development.
- Production Environment: Use server-configured headers to manage CORS, or integrate with third-party services using provided APIs with proper authentication.
   
## System Flow
- Initialization: On application start, the service worker is registered, and local storage is checked to restore the state.
- Playback: When a user plays a video, playback progress is tracked and saved continuously. If the video ends, the progress is reset.
- Offline Downloading: Users can opt to download videos for offline use, with the content being cached by the service worker.
- Playback Resumption: Upon revisiting or reloading the application, the video player retrieves the saved progress and resumes playback from the last known position.
- Seeking: Users can click on the progress bar to seek to different positions within the video.
